# Overview

### Executive Summary

Global Beer Shop is a business conceptualised by our clients to sell premium beers from around the world - with a target to sell at least one beer from every country that produces it. They wish to begin by selling beers on an eCommerce website and mobile app, then open physical shops around the world upon expansion. The website will act as not only a medium for selling beers, but also as a “portfolio of beers” when contracting new beer distributors. Our clients have already purchased the domain names, _globalbeershop.com_ and _globalbeershop.co.uk_, but have postponed the development of their business for 3 years due to lack of technical skills. 

### Application Domain and Business Sector
Our project is to deliver 1) an e-commerce website for Global Beer Shop, and 2) a corresponding mobile app. In this business sector, the existing competitors (and potentially inspirations) include _Beer Hawk, Beers of Europe_ and _Beer Wulf_.

It should be noted that the website is the most important product to create on this project, while creating the app will depend on the time we have left after delivering the website. Our client would prefer a higher quality website with no app, as opposed to rushing the website in order to have time to develop the app. 

### Key Problem 
Our client’s problem is that they are lacking an entry point into the online beer sales market. The e-commerce website and app will solve this problem - using them, the Global Beer Shop will finally be able to market and sell their products.

The clients have specified that the website must be aimed at an older, higher-end market (e.g. 25+ year olds interested in novelty/specialised beers). They would prefer if the website had a Western/Wild West inspired theme, and that is should emphasise to customers the global-spanning selection beers - one of the clients suggested even having some form of interactive world map that can show customers the beers currently in stock for a given country. The Global Beer Shop website has to allow for payments via Card and Paypal. We do not need to develop or provide any other external systems (e.g. stock database, delivery providers, payment account): just the website (and hopefully the mobile app).

### Our Vision

Beginning in October 2018, our project will last around 6-months - after which we hope to deliver functioning product(s) to our clients which fulfill all their requirements, along with full deployment documentation. However, we have chosen to follow an agile development methodology where the project will be developed iteratively and incrementally; with several version releases of increasing functionality before the final release. We hope to release the system as a Minimum Viable Product around December 2018, then as a Beta version in February 2019, and finally releasing the Final version around April 2019. This is to maximise the amount of time our clients can interact with some working version of the system before the final release, which will allow us to receive consistent feedback on the development.

Development will also be agile, with one to two week long sprints to develop each release. In addition, we will also take a Test-Driven approach: we create the unit tests for code before we actually implement, meaning that we write code with the aim to pass the tests (ensuring we meet our requirements).

This agile methodology primarily focuses on software development - however, we will use a similar prototype-based development process for the front-end website User Interface. We will validate the UI using feedback from our clients, rather than using unit tests. This is because, unlike the functionality of the system, we can expect the requirements for the UI will be change often, as our clients will likely change their vision for their website many times throughout the project.
