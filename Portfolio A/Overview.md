# Overview

### 1.1 - Executive Summary

Global Beer Shop is an idea conceptualised by our clients to sell premium beers from around the world - with a target to sell at least one beer from every country that produces it. They wish to begin by selling beers on an eCommerce website, then open physical shops around the world upon expansion. The website will act as not only a medium for selling beers, but also as a “portfolio of beers” when contracting new beer distributors. 

An additional task which we may eventually materialise is an app which reflects the eCommerce website but with less features - making the process of buying a beer as fast and easy as possible from their shop. It should be noted that the website is the most important product to create on this project, while creating the app will depend on the time we have left. Our client would prefer a higher quality website with no app as opposed to rushing the website in order to make time for the app. They have purchased the domain names, “globalbeershop.com” and “globalbeershop.co.uk”, but have postponed the idea for 2-3 years due to lack of technical skills. 

### 1.2 - Application Domain / Business Sector
The deliverable is a fully functional eCommerce website for selling beers from around the world. There are already direct competitors from which we will derive inspiration, namely Beer Hawk, Europe Beers and Beer Wulf.

### 1.3 - Key Problem 
Our client’s problem is that they are lacking an entry point into the beer sales market. The eCommerce website will solve this problem. They will be able to turn a profit and gain notoriety for their brand name.

We suspect that key problems associated with making an ecommerce website will be: linking payment methods to the website; the security issues encompassing this functionality; and finding a way to store customer accounts.

### 1.4 - Our Vision
For the prototyping process, we have started to follow the rapid prototyping process, which involves three stages: Paper Prototyping, Digital Prototyping and Native Prototyping.
Starting with Paper Prototyping, we have sketched the layout of the webpages included in the MVP: homepage, shop, individual product page, basket, checkout and order complete page.
After we have done those, we started the Digital Prototyping phase, bringing our sketches to life using Photoshop as a design tool.

Throughout our development we will use an agile development methodology, meaning we plan on quickly providing the client with minimal working software, which we will continuously build upon with rapid development cycles. By using an agile process and making sure we have frequent meetings with our client, we will hopefully be able to create the exact system the clients have in mind, even if their ideas and requirements change.

We will be developing the project in three stages, each concluding in; an MVP, a beta release and a final release. The MVP will have minimal functionalities required for a simple ecommerce website. The beta release should be an improvement on this - with additional functionalities as well as completely polished functionalities which were present in the MVP. Lastly the final release should be a fully functioning ecommerce website with all the desired outcomes achieved.

As requested by our clients in an initial meeting, we will be creating a “wild western” themed eCommerce website (Figure 1). The website should enable a visitor to browse through our client’s beer catalogue, to order as many items from the current stock as they want and to pay either by card, PayPal, or cash on delivery. The website has to be responsive, SEO-friendly and fulfill the purpose of making it possible for a customer to choose and order beer from the company’s catalogue. In addition to this each beer should have a description about where and how it is brewed, along with a description of its flavours. Each beer should be queryable by its country, brewery, style and ABV (alcohol percentage). Our clients have also requested for it to be possible for customers to create an account on our website, for which we will have to build a database of users. However, since this is not required for an MVP, we will be implementing this later on.
	
Our clients also informed us of a Home Page design idea which they would like: an interactive map of the world, where users can hover over countries/continents and see suggestions for/see all the beers on sale from that area. This functionality will be derived from the the original filter options that we put into our MVP, but will not be included in the MVP itself.
