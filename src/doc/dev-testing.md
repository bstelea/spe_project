# Development Testing
To facilitate the development process, the tests will have to be described before the coding sprint starts. One of the core components of the ecommerce website is the shopping cart, the object providing functionality for storing the beers selected from the catalogue to be bought. It will undertake both blackbox and whitebox testing, as will the whole project structure, in order to identify as many design flaws as possible. The tests will be implemented using the JUnit framework. The "shopping cart" object will play a fundamental role for a customer to place an order on the website, thus it will need to be fully and comprehensively tested. The table below illustrates tests for the functionality of the "shopping cart" component:   
 

  
 Test ID       | Description          | Input        | Output 
 :---: | --- | --- | --- 
Sum Order Total | The "shopping cart" will calculate the total price of the beers included in the order summary.  | List of beer items with a "name", "number of items" and "price" field; example input 1: ([("Heineken", 2, 5), ("Fosters", 1, 5)]); example input 2: ([ ]) | Sum of the values stored in the "price" field; example output 1: 15, example output 2: 0
Add item to shopping cart | Whenever the website user adds one or more items to the shopping cart, the list of items in the order summary has to be updated to contain the new item | List of beer items and a mock item containing a field called "number of items" ; example input 1: ([ ] , ("Heineken", 2, 5)), example input 2: ([("Heineken", 2, 5)] , ("Heineken", 2, 5)), example input 2: ([("Heineken", 2, 5)], ("Fosters", 1, 5))  | The same list of items as the one used as an input value, having exactly the number of mock items specified in the input added to it; example output 1: [("Heineken, 2, 5)], example output 2: [("Heineken, 4, 5)], example output 3: [("Heineken, 2, 5), ("Fosters", 1, 5)]
Remove item from shopping cart | When the user of the website removes one or more beer items from the shopping cart the list of beers in the order summary has to be updated having the selected items removed, and the total order price has to be updated by decreasing the removed items' price | List of beer items, a mock item having a name, number of items and price fields to be removed; example input 1: ([("Heineken", 1, 5)], ("Heineken", 1, 5)), example input 2: ([("Heineken", 1, 5)], ("Heineken", 1, 4)), example input 3: ([("Heineken", 1, 5)], ("Fosters", 1, 5)), example input 4: ([("Heineken", 1, 5)], ("Heineken", 2, 5)), example input 5: ([("Heineken", 2, 5), ("Fosters", 1, 5)], ("Heineken", 1, 5)) | List of beer items having the exact number of mock items removed, or throw an error if the function is called with invalid parameters (such as removing a beer from a list in which the mock item appears less times than the number in the input value, or removing an item from a list in which it does not appear); example output 1: [ ], example output 2: error(), example output 3: error(), example output 4: error(), example output 5: [("Heineken", 1, 5), ("Fosters", 1, 5)]
Remove all elements from shopping cart | Change available stock when item is added | Change available stock when item is removed | Discard changes when item dropped from shopping cart in available stock | Add beers only if in stock | Quantity shown is the same as the one is the same | Check that object attributes match in and out of shopping cart | It shouldn't exist after the expity date |
